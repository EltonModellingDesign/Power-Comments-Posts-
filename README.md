# Power-Comments-Posts-
Actually I created 2 sort of aplications in one, the first purpose it's to right comments and post in the site and you can even edit the text 
that is something you don't see every day,It didn't get perfect, next time I would like to create a kind of registration profile before post something 
and hind the html tags when edit. But I sharped my skills and for who wants to create something similar or even improve my work be welcome. 

One detail its in portuguese

When you download the archiev, first unpack with Winrar and after that you can execute the HTML file(CommentIndex)
